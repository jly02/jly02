### Hi, I'm Jonathan! 🐼

I'm a computer science major at the University of Washington. My interests span several theoretical and applied disciplines, including computational complexity theory, cryptography, logic and programming languages, and formal methods. It might seem like a lot to some, but there's no reason to believe these topics are all disjoint: if I don't know what the intersection is yet, I simply have to learn more.

And while these may sound highly academic, I am equally enthusiastic about applying my knowledge to real-world situations!

### What I'm Up To

Currently, I'm a research assistant at the [HPDIC](https://hpdic.github.io/) lab. My work is about designing and implementing cryptographic protocols which leverage caching and the power of [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) to accelerate encryption operations for large batches of data (see: [RacheAL](https://github.com/jly02/RacheAL)).

### A Cool Theorem
**Theorem**. Let $L \in \mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{co}\text{-}\mathsf{NP}$. Then there is a polynomial-time turing machine $\mathcal{M}$ taking inputs $(x, u)$ with the following properties:
$$x \in L \implies M(x, u) \in \\{ 1, ? \\} \text{ for all } u,~ M(x, u) = 1 \text{ for at least one } u$$
$$x \notin L \implies M(x, u) \in \\{ 0, ? \\} \text{ for all } u,~ M(x, u) = 0 \text{ for at least one } u$$

_Proof_. We are given that $L$ has polynomial-time verifiers for both _yes_ and _no_ instances. Call these verifiers $V_y$ and $V_n$. We design the following simple algorithm to be run by $\mathcal{M}$.

>$\quad \texttt{procedure } \mathcal{M}(x, u)$ 
>
>$\quad \qquad b_y \gets V_y(x, u)$ 
>
>$\quad \qquad b_n \gets V_n(x, u)$
>
>$\quad \qquad \texttt{if } b_y = 1:~ \texttt{return 1}$
>
>$\quad \qquad \texttt{if } b_n = 1:~ \texttt{return 0}$
>
>$\quad \qquad \texttt{return ?}$
>
>$\quad \texttt{end}$

Note that we cannot have both $x \in L$ and $x \notin L$, so $V_y$ and $V_n$ never both output 1. Then the cases are easy to check:
- $x \in L$. Then $\mathcal{M}$ either outputs 1 if $u$ is a good certificate, or $?$ if $u$ is a bad certificate.
- $x \notin L$. Same as before. $\mathcal{M}$ outputs 0 if $u$ is a good certificate, and $?$ otherwise.

So $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies our properties! And since $V_y$ and $V_n$ run in polynomial-time, $\mathcal{M}$ is guaranteed to as well. Thus, the claim is proven. $\blacksquare$
